Encode your questions below.  Indicate as well the algorithm(s) to be used in answering each question.
Questions with parameter(s) should have the parameter(s) encoded in angled brackets, for example, <parameter-name>. 

Q1: How many countries have values <greater/less> than <number> in <param_risk_factor>? Also, what are the names of these countries? (print array of strings) [algorithm(s): count]

Q2: What are the top 5 factors affecting life expectancy for each of the following countries, <5_countries>, arranged in descending order of value, and what are their top <number> average leading factors? (print array of strings) [algorithm(s): linear search or binary search after sorting, average, selection sort]

Q3: How do <countryA> and <countryB>’s parameter risk factors compare? [algorithm(s): binary search] 

Q4: Identifying Outliers: Are there locations that have values <greater/less> than the average value of life expectancy (not including global)? If yes, how many? (print array of strings) [algorithm(s): Count, average]

Q5: Indicate and compare the countries with minimum and maximum LE. For each of the two countries, how many factors affecting LE exceed the value of <number>, and what are those identified factors, arranged in ascending order for each? (print array of strings) [algorithm(s): minimum, maximum, count, selection sort]
